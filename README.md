### ChatBot with Dynamic Learning

This repository contains a simple, interactive chatbot built in Python that uses a JSON-based knowledge base for responses. The chatbot dynamically expands its knowledge by learning new responses directly from user interactions, making it an adaptable and continuously evolving conversational agent.

#### Features
- **Interactive Learning**: When the chatbot encounters an unknown input, it prompts the user to provide a response, which is then stored in the knowledge base.
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Uses JSON for knowledge storage, allowing easy response retrieval and updating without data loss.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Basic NLP functions like tokenization and pattern matching, implemented with NLTK, improve the accuracy and responsiveness of the bot.

#### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries with `pip install nltk`.
3. Run the chatbot script to start an interactive chat session.

#### Usage
Ideal for anyone looking to experiment with simple chatbot development, dynamic learning systems, or basic NLP in Python.
